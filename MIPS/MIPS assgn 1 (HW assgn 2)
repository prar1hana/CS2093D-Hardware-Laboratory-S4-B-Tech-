Compute the factorial of a given positive number.
Check whether the given positive number is a palindrome or not.
Convert a given 32-bit binary number to its decimal equivalent.
Determine if a given integer is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (1, 2, and 3) equals 6.
Check if a given number is an Armstrong number or not. [Example: Armstrong Number is 153 as (1*1*1) +(5*5*5) +(3*3*3) = 153.
Find the number of prime numbers and print them in a given range.
Find a given element (key) from the input array using a linear search.
Find the nth Fibonacci number for the given number n.
Perform an addition operation on two numbers, A and B. Where A is a signed number and B is the 2's complement of A.
