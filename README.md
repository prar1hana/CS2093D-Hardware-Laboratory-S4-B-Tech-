0th-Assignment
This assignment focuses on implementing various hardware components using Verilog HDL and acting as a prerequisite for the hardware lab (CS2093D).

Design and implement the following logic functions using Verilog with behavioral modeling: Subsequently, simulate and verify all the given logic functions using ModelSim integrated with Intel Quartus software. You are supposed to write the test bench with all the cases for every design.

1. An 8-bit adder with sum and carry as output.
2. An 8-bit subtractor with a difference and borrow as output.
3. An 8-bit ALU that can perform addition, subtraction, bitwise XOR, and left shift operations.
4. 8-bit D latch with enable an active low reset.
